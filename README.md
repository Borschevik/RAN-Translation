# RAN-Translation

Source files, databases and scripts for finding ORFs associated with RAN translation in human genome.

### Scripts used in project

BioHack-Pipe.ipynb - jupyter notebook with pipeline to find ORFs with RAN

protein_parser_analysis.py - script to analyze for transorming ORFs into proteins and finding homorepeats 

transform_DNA_into_protein.py - transform DNA sequence into protein

save_id_from_fasta.py - retrieve ID from fasta

DB_proj.R - R script for analysis of database

### Repeats database

norm_database.txt - database of repeats in hg38 from https://tandem.bu.edu 

final_db.csv - database with potential RAN ORFs from tandem repeats database
